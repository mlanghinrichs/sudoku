Sudoku.py can be run with command-line arguments or imported and used as a
module. Read 'python sudoku.py --help' for argparse usage. Verbosity ('-v') is
recommended for comprehension.

Sudoku.py is a combined algorithmic and recursive-guessing sudoku solver which
utilizes Sudoku objects. A Sudoku object's initialization takes a 9x9 list of
lists and saves that to its raw attribute, or processes a space-and-newline
separated text file into a list of lists via the class method process_txt().

The solve() method first runs through the fill_possibles() and only_possibles
methods until they cannot change the puzzle any further. If the puzzle is
solved, it prints a success message and prints the solved puzzle. If the puzzle
is still incomplete and the guess_last flag is set to true (which it is by
default), it then drops into the guess() method to finish out the puzzle.
Finally, it returns itself (the solved Sudoku object).

The solve_by_guessing() method does not use algorithmic solving first, but
recursively guesses possible values and checks if they produce a valid Sudoku
until the puzzle is full. It also returns the solved object.
